2025-01-16 15:10:50,546 - INFO - To ensure that the phone does not enter sleep mode when the application is running in the foreground, you typically need to acquire a **WakeLock** in your application. However, based on your task, you want to **prevent the phone from entering sleep mode** when the app is running in the foreground. This is usually done by acquiring a `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` or `SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK` in the relevant activities.

From the provided information, it seems that the app already has a setting to control this behavior, as indicated by the `settings_prevent_phone_from_sleeping` checkbox in the `SettingsActivity`. This suggests that the app might already have logic to handle wake locks.

### Steps to Ensure the Phone Does Not Enter Sleep Mode:

1. **Identify the WakeLock Logic:**
   - Look for code that acquires or releases a `WakeLock` in the app. This is typically done using the `PowerManager` class.
   - Search for `PowerManager`, `WakeLock`, or `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` in the codebase.

2. **Check the `MainActivity` and Other Relevant Activities:**
   - The `MainActivity` is likely the primary activity where the app runs in the foreground. Check if it acquires a `WakeLock` when the activity is in the foreground.
   - Also, check `ReminderActivity` and `SnoozeReminderActivity`, as these might need to keep the phone awake during reminders or alarms.

3. **Review the `SettingsActivity` Logic:**
   - The `settings_prevent_phone_from_sleeping` checkbox suggests that the app has a user-controlled setting to prevent the phone from sleeping. Ensure that this setting is respected in the relevant activities.
   - If the checkbox is checked, the app should acquire a `WakeLock`; if unchecked, it should release the `WakeLock`.

4. **Modify the Code to Prevent Sleep Mode:**
   - If the app does not already handle this, you can add the following code to acquire a `WakeLock` in the `onResume()` method of the relevant activities and release it in `onPause()`:

   ```java
   import android.os.PowerManager;

   public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
       private PowerManager.WakeLock wakeLock;

       @Override
       protected void onResume() {
           super.onResume();
           PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager) getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
           wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, "MyApp::MyWakelockTag");
           wakeLock.acquire();
       }

       @Override
       protected void onPause() {
           super.onPause();
           if (wakeLock != null && wakeLock.isHeld()) {
               wakeLock.release();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - Ensure that you add the appropriate permission in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
   ```

5. **Test the Behavior:**
   - Run the app and verify that the phone does not enter sleep mode when the app is in the foreground.
   - Test the behavior with the `settings_prevent_phone_from_sleeping` checkbox both checked and unchecked to ensure the setting is respected.

### Example Implementation in `MainActivity`:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private PowerManager.WakeLock wakeLock;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        // Check if the setting to prevent sleep is enabled
        if (isPreventSleepEnabled()) {
            PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager) getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
            wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, "MyApp::MyWakelockTag");
            wakeLock.acquire();
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        if (wakeLock != null && wakeLock.isHeld()) {
            wakeLock.release();
        }
    }

    private boolean isPreventSleepEnabled() {
        // Retrieve the setting from SharedPreferences or wherever it is stored
        SharedPreferences preferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this);
        return preferences.getBoolean("prevent_phone_from_sleeping", false);
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, you can ensure that the phone does not enter sleep mode when the app is running in the foreground. If the app already has a setting for this, make sure the logic is correctly implemented and respected in the relevant activities. If not, you can add the necessary `WakeLock` logic as shown above.
