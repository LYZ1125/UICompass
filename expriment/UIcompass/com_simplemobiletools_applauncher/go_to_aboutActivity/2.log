        Based on the previous analysis,here is the instructions:

        {'task': 'go to aboutActivity', 'activities_sequence': [{'activity': 'SplashActivity', 'steps': ['1. Launch the app to start at SplashActivity.', '2. SplashActivity initializes and transitions to MainActivity.']}, {'activity': 'MainActivity', 'steps': ['3. Navigate to the options menu in MainActivity.', "4. Select the 'About' menu item to trigger the 'launchAbout' method."]}, {'activity': 'AboutActivity', 'steps': ["5. AboutActivity is launched, displaying the 'About' section of the app."]}], 'explanation': "because the 'About' menu item in MainActivity triggers the launch of AboutActivity."}

        Here is the history_actions:

        Activity: unknown
  - Event(action=back, widget=None)
  - Event(action=back, widget=None)
        Last time, we believed we were at 3:.  

        Now, we just performed Event(action=back, widget=None).  
        Therefore, we want to know which step of the instructions is about Event(action=back, widget=None).
        Please return in JSON format, such as:  
        
{ "step": 1 }

Note that: **Do not output anything except the json format answer.**

        Here is the instructions:

        Here is the history_actions:

        Activity: unknown
  - Event(action=back, widget=None)
  - Event(action=back, widget=None)
        We would like to know if these instructions are correct according the history_actions.   
        It seems that we were at step-3 in the instructions.  
        You need to refer to the elements on the current interface, combined with the instructions and historical execution information, to determine whether our task has been finished.
        If the task is finished, return {"finish": true, "reason": "Task objective achieved"}; otherwise, return {"finish": false, "reason": "The reason why not finished."}.
 Just provide the result according at JSON format.
 Do not output any others.
