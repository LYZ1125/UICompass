2024-12-31 15:13:54,082 - INFO - To disable the autosave feature in the app, you will need to focus on the `SettingsActivity` and the associated `ManageAutoBackupsDialog` fragment. Here¡¯s a step-by-step guide on how to approach this task:

### 1. **Identify the Autosave Setting in `SettingsActivity`**
   - Open the `activity_settings.xml` file to locate the UI element (e.g., a switch, checkbox, or button) that controls the autosave feature.
   - Look for an element like `SwitchCompat`, `CheckBox`, or `Button` with an ID related to autosave (e.g., `autoSaveSwitch`, `enableAutoSave`, etc.).

### 2. **Modify the Autosave Logic**
   - Open the `SettingsActivity` Java/Kotlin file.
   - Locate the code that handles the autosave setting. This is typically tied to the UI element identified in the previous step.
   - Disable the autosave functionality by either:
     - Setting the default state of the autosave switch/checkbox to `false`.
     - Removing or commenting out the code that triggers the autosave functionality.

### 3. **Update the `ManageAutoBackupsDialog` Fragment**
   - Open the `ManageAutoBackupsDialog` fragment layout file to check if there are any UI elements related to autosave.
   - Open the `ManageAutoBackupsDialog` Java/Kotlin file and locate the logic that handles autosave.
   - Disable or remove the autosave functionality in this fragment as well.

### 4. **Test the Changes**
   - Build and run the app to ensure that the autosave feature is disabled.
   - Verify that no notes are being saved automatically after making changes.

### Example Code Changes

#### `activity_settings.xml`
If there¡¯s a switch for autosave:
```xml
<SwitchCompat
    android:id="@+id/autoSaveSwitch"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="Enable Autosave"
    android:checked="false" /> <!-- Set default to false -->
```

#### `SettingsActivity.java`
Disable the autosave logic:
```java
SwitchCompat autoSaveSwitch = findViewById(R.id.autoSaveSwitch);
autoSaveSwitch.setChecked(false); // Ensure the switch is off by default

autoSaveSwitch.setOnCheckedChangeListener((buttonView, isChecked) -> {
    if (isChecked) {
        // Disable autosave functionality
        // Toast.makeText(this, "Autosave is disabled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        autoSaveSwitch.setChecked(false); // Keep the switch off
    }
});
```

#### `ManageAutoBackupsDialog.java`
Disable autosave in the fragment:
```java
// Locate the autosave logic and disable it
// For example, if there's a method that enables autosave, comment it out
// enableAutoSave();
```

### 5. **Rebuild and Test**
   - Rebuild the app and test the changes to ensure that the autosave feature is completely disabled.

### Additional Considerations
- If the autosave feature is tied to a backend service or scheduled task, ensure that those are also disabled or removed.
- Check for any shared preferences or settings that might enable autosave and ensure they are set to `false` by default.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully disable the autosave notes feature in the app.
