2024-12-31 15:10:28,475 - INFO - To achieve the task of setting the app theme to light and saving it, you will need to interact with the `SettingsActivity` of the app. This activity is likely where the app's theme settings are managed. Here¡¯s a step-by-step guide on how to approach this:

### Step 1: Identify the Theme Setting in `SettingsActivity`
- Open the `activity_settings.xml` file to locate the UI elements related to theme settings.
- Look for a `RadioGroup`, `Spinner`, or `Switch` that allows the user to select between light, dark, or other theme options.

### Step 2: Locate the Corresponding Code in `SettingsActivity`
- Open the `SettingsActivity.java` or `SettingsActivity.kt` file.
- Search for the method that handles the theme selection. This method is likely triggered when the user changes the theme setting in the UI.

### Step 3: Set the Theme to Light
- In the method that handles theme selection, find the code that sets the theme.
- Modify the code to set the theme to light. This might involve setting a specific theme resource or updating a shared preference value.

### Step 4: Save the Theme Setting
- Ensure that the selected theme is saved persistently. This is typically done using `SharedPreferences`.
- Look for code that saves the theme setting to `SharedPreferences` and ensure it is updated with the light theme value.

### Example Code Snippet
Here¡¯s an example of what the code might look like in `SettingsActivity`:

```java
// In SettingsActivity.java

// Assuming you have a RadioGroup for theme selection
RadioGroup themeRadioGroup = findViewById(R.id.theme_radio_group);

themeRadioGroup.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new RadioGroup.OnCheckedChangeListener() {
    @Override
    public void onCheckedChanged(RadioGroup group, int checkedId) {
        if (checkedId == R.id.light_theme_radio_button) {
            // Set the theme to light
            AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode(AppCompatDelegate.MODE_NIGHT_NO);
            
            // Save the theme setting
            SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(SettingsActivity.this);
            SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();
            editor.putString("theme_preference", "light");
            editor.apply();
        }
    }
});
```

### Step 5: Apply the Theme on App Launch
- Ensure that the app applies the saved theme when it launches. This is typically done in the `SplashActivity` or `MainActivity`.
- Retrieve the saved theme from `SharedPreferences` and apply it.

### Example Code Snippet for Applying Theme on Launch
```java
// In SplashActivity.java or MainActivity.java

SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this);
String themePreference = sharedPreferences.getString("theme_preference", "light");

if (themePreference.equals("light")) {
    AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode(AppCompatDelegate.MODE_NIGHT_NO);
} else {
    AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode(AppCompatDelegate.MODE_NIGHT_YES);
}
```

### Step 6: Test the Changes
- Run the app and navigate to the `SettingsActivity`.
- Select the light theme option and ensure that the theme changes immediately.
- Restart the app to verify that the light theme is applied on launch.

By following these steps, you should be able to set the app theme to light and save it persistently.
