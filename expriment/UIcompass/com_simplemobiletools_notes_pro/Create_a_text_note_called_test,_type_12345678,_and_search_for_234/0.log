2024-12-31 15:15:38,275 - INFO - To accomplish the task of creating a text note called "test", typing "12345678", and searching for "234" in the Simple Mobile Tools Notes Pro app, you need to interact with the `MainActivity` and its associated fragments. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to achieve this:

### 1. **Launch the App**
   - The app starts with `SplashActivity`, which likely transitions to `MainActivity` after a brief loading period.

### 2. **Navigate to MainActivity**
   - `MainActivity` is the primary activity where you can view, create, and manage notes. It contains fragments like `NotesPagerAdapter`, `NoteFragment`, and `TextFragment`.

### 3. **Create a New Note**
   - In `MainActivity`, you need to find the UI element (e.g., a button) that allows you to create a new note. This is typically represented by a "+" button or similar.
   - Click on the button to create a new note. This will likely open a dialog or a new fragment where you can enter the note's title and content.

### 4. **Enter the Note Title and Content**
   - In the note creation dialog or fragment:
     - Enter "test" as the note title.
     - Enter "12345678" as the note content.
   - Save the note. This will add the note to the list of notes in `MainActivity`.

### 5. **Search for the Text "234"**
   - In `MainActivity`, locate the search functionality. This is usually represented by a search icon (magnifying glass) or a search bar at the top of the screen.
   - Click on the search icon or enter the search bar.
   - Type "234" in the search bar.
   - The app should filter the notes and display any notes that contain the substring "234". Since the note you created contains "12345678", it should match and be displayed in the search results.

### 6. **Verify the Search Results**
   - Ensure that the note titled "test" with content "12345678" appears in the search results for "234".

### Summary of Steps:
1. Launch the app (`SplashActivity` ¡ú `MainActivity`).
2. Create a new note with the title "test" and content "12345678".
3. Use the search functionality to search for "234".
4. Verify that the note appears in the search results.

### Relevant Fragments and Activities:
- **MainActivity**: The main screen where notes are displayed and managed.
- **NotesPagerAdapter**: Manages the different fragments within `MainActivity`.
- **NoteFragment**: Displays individual notes.
- **TextFragment**: Handles the text input and display for notes.

### Notes:
- The exact UI elements (buttons, search bar, etc.) may vary slightly depending on the app's version and customization.
- If the app has a tutorial or onboarding process, you may need to complete that before accessing the main functionality.

By following these steps, you should be able to complete the task successfully.
