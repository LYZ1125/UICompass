2025-01-16 22:19:09,963 - INFO - To change the theme of the Music Player app to a light theme and save it, you need to modify the app's theme settings. Based on the provided information, the `SettingsActivity` is the most relevant activity for this task, as it typically handles app customization, including theme changes.

### Steps to Change the Theme to Light and Save It:

1. **Identify the Theme Setting in `SettingsActivity`:**
   - The `SettingsActivity` layout (`R.layout.activity_settings`) contains a section for color customization, which is likely where the theme settings are managed.
   - Look for the `settings_color_customization_holder` or similar elements that might control the theme.

2. **Modify the Theme Setting:**
   - If the app uses a predefined set of themes (e.g., light, dark, system default), you need to locate the code that handles theme selection.
   - In the `SettingsActivity` class, search for methods or variables related to theme changes. For example, look for `setTheme()` or `applyTheme()` methods.

3. **Change the Theme to Light:**
   - If the app uses a `SharedPreferences` or similar mechanism to save theme preferences, you need to update the preference to the light theme.
   - For example, if the theme is stored as a string (e.g., `"light"`, `"dark"`), you would set it to `"light"`.

4. **Save the Theme Preference:**
   - After changing the theme, ensure the preference is saved using `SharedPreferences.Editor` or a similar method.
   - For example:
     ```java
     SharedPreferences preferences = getSharedPreferences("app_settings", MODE_PRIVATE);
     SharedPreferences.Editor editor = preferences.edit();
     editor.putString("theme", "light");
     editor.apply();
     ```

5. **Apply the Theme Immediately:**
   - To apply the theme immediately, you might need to restart the activity or recreate it.
   - For example:
     ```java
     recreate();
     ```

### Example Code Snippet:

Here¡¯s an example of how you might implement the theme change in `SettingsActivity`:

```java
public class SettingsActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private SharedPreferences preferences;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_settings);

        preferences = getSharedPreferences("app_settings", MODE_PRIVATE);

        // Assuming you have a button or switch to change the theme
        Button lightThemeButton = findViewById(R.id.light_theme_button);
        lightThemeButton.setOnClickListener(v -> setLightTheme());
    }

    private void setLightTheme() {
        // Save the light theme preference
        SharedPreferences.Editor editor = preferences.edit();
        editor.putString("theme", "light");
        editor.apply();

        // Apply the theme immediately
        recreate();
    }
}
```

### Layout Example:

If you want to add a button to switch to the light theme in `activity_settings.xml`, you can add something like this:

```xml
<Button
    android:id="@+id/light_theme_button"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="Set Light Theme"
    android:layout_below="@+id/settings_color_customization_label"
    android:layout_marginTop="16dp"/>
```

### Notes:
- The exact implementation may vary depending on how the app is structured and how themes are managed.
- If the app uses a third-party library for theme management, you may need to refer to the library's documentation for specific instructions.
- Ensure that the light theme is properly defined in the app's `styles.xml` or `themes.xml` file.

By following these steps, you should be able to change the theme of the Music Player app to a light theme and save the preference.
