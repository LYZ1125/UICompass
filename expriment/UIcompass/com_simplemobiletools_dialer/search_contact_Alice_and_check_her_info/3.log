2025-01-18 18:26:09,857 - INFO - To achieve the task of searching for a contact named "Alice" and checking her information, you need to interact with the `MainActivity` of the app, as it is the primary activity where you can search for contacts and view their details. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this:

### Step 1: Launch the App
- The app starts with `SplashActivity`, which is likely a loading screen. Wait for it to transition to `MainActivity`.

### Step 2: Access the Search Functionality
- In `MainActivity`, locate the search element. Based on the layout description, the search element is likely the `MySearchMenu` with the ID `@+id/main_menu`.
- Click on the search element to activate the search functionality.

### Step 3: Enter the Contact Name
- Once the search bar is active, type "Alice" into the search field. This will filter the contacts to show only those matching the name "Alice".

### Step 4: Select the Contact
- After the search results are displayed, locate the contact named "Alice" in the list. This list is likely displayed within a `RecyclerView` or a similar component.
- Click on the contact "Alice" to view her detailed information.

### Step 5: View Contact Information
- Upon selecting "Alice", the app should navigate to a detailed view of her contact information. This could be within the same `MainActivity` or a different activity, depending on the app's design.
- Review the displayed information, which may include her phone number, email, and other details.

### Summary of Actions:
1. **Launch the App**: Start from `SplashActivity` and wait for `MainActivity` to load.
2. **Access Search**: Click on the search element (`@+id/main_menu`) in `MainActivity`.
3. **Enter Name**: Type "Alice" in the search bar.
4. **Select Contact**: Click on "Alice" from the filtered list.
5. **View Info**: Review the detailed contact information displayed.

### Notes:
- If the app uses a different activity to display contact details, you may need to navigate to that activity after selecting the contact.
- Ensure that the contact "Alice" exists in your contact list for the search to yield results.

By following these steps, you should be able to search for the contact "Alice" and check her information within the app.
