2025-01-18 15:55:51,880 - INFO - To achieve the target task of "taking a short selfie video," you need to interact with the `MainActivity` of the app, which is the primary activity for capturing photos and videos. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to accomplish this task based on the provided layout and activity information:

---

### **Steps to Take a Short Selfie Video**

1. **Launch the App and Navigate to MainActivity**:
   - The app starts with `SplashActivity`, which likely transitions to `MainActivity` automatically after a brief delay.
   - Ensure that the app is launched and `MainActivity` is displayed.

2. **Switch to Video Mode**:
   - In `MainActivity`, there is a `TabLayout` (`@+id/camera_mode_tab`) with two tabs: **Video** and **Photo**.
   - Locate the `TabItem` with the text `@string/video` and click it to switch the camera mode to video recording.

3. **Switch to Front Camera**:
   - There is an `ImageView` with the ID `@+id/toggle_camera` and the content description `@string/toggle_camera`. This button is used to switch between the front and rear cameras.
   - Click the `toggle_camera` button to switch to the front (selfie) camera.

4. **Start Recording**:
   - The `ImageView` with the ID `@+id/shutter` and the content description `@string/shutter` is the main button for capturing photos or starting/stopping video recording.
   - Click the `shutter` button to start recording the video.

5. **Monitor Recording Time**:
   - While recording, a `TextView` with the ID `@+id/video_rec_curr_timer` displays the current recording time (e.g., `00:00`).
   - Monitor this timer to ensure the video is of the desired length.

6. **Stop Recording**:
   - Click the `shutter` button again to stop the recording.

7. **Review the Video**:
   - After stopping the recording, the `ImageView` with the ID `@+id/last_photo_video_preview` and the content description `@string/view_last_media` allows you to preview the last captured photo or video.
   - Click this button to review the recorded selfie video.

---

### **Key UI Elements and Their Roles**
- **`@+id/camera_mode_tab`**: Switches between photo and video modes.
- **`@+id/toggle_camera`**: Toggles between front and rear cameras.
- **`@+id/shutter`**: Starts and stops video recording.
- **`@+id/video_rec_curr_timer`**: Displays the current recording time.
- **`@+id/last_photo_video_preview`**: Previews the last captured media.

---

### **Additional Considerations**
- **Flash Settings**: If you need to adjust the flash for the selfie video, use the `@+id/toggle_flash` button in the `@layout/layout_top` layout.
- **Timer Settings**: If you want to add a delay before recording starts, use the `@+id/toggle_timer` button in the `@layout/layout_top` layout to set a timer (e.g., 3s, 5s, or 10s).
- **Resolution Settings**: If you want to change the video resolution, use the `@+id/change_resolution` button in the `@layout/layout_top` layout.

---

### **Summary**
To take a short selfie video:
1. Switch to **Video Mode**.
2. Switch to the **Front Camera**.
3. Start recording using the **Shutter Button**.
4. Stop recording after the desired duration.
5. Review the video using the **Last Media Preview** button.

This sequence leverages the provided UI elements and layouts to achieve the task efficiently.
