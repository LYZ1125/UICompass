2025-01-18 16:12:54,556 - INFO - To achieve the task of checking the size of the last photo taken, you need to interact with the `MainActivity` of the app, specifically with the `last_photo_video_preview` element, which is an `ImageView` that likely displays the last photo or video taken. Here's a step-by-step approach to accomplish this:

### Step 1: Identify the Last Photo
The `last_photo_video_preview` element in the `MainActivity` layout is likely used to display the last photo or video taken. This element has the ID `@+id/last_photo_video_preview`.

### Step 2: Access the Last Photo
To access the last photo, you need to:
1. **Locate the `last_photo_video_preview` element** in the `MainActivity`.
2. **Retrieve the image** displayed in this `ImageView`.

### Step 3: Check the Size of the Last Photo
Once you have access to the image, you can check its size. This involves:
1. **Getting the bitmap** from the `ImageView`.
2. **Calculating the size** of the bitmap in bytes.

### Step 4: Implement the Code
Here¡¯s a sample implementation in Kotlin:

```kotlin
// Assuming you are in the MainActivity
val lastPhotoPreview: ImageView = findViewById(R.id.last_photo_video_preview)

// Get the drawable from the ImageView
val drawable = lastPhotoPreview.drawable

if (drawable is BitmapDrawable) {
    val bitmap = drawable.bitmap

    // Calculate the size of the bitmap in bytes
    val sizeInBytes = bitmap.allocationByteCount

    // Convert the size to a more readable format (e.g., KB or MB)
    val sizeInKB = sizeInBytes / 1024
    val sizeInMB = sizeInKB / 1024

    // Display the size (you can use a Toast, Log, or any other method)
    Toast.makeText(this, "Last photo size: $sizeInKB KB ($sizeInMB MB)", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
} else {
    Toast.makeText(this, "No photo found", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
}
```

### Step 5: Handle Edge Cases
- **No Photo Available**: If the `last_photo_video_preview` does not contain any image, handle this case gracefully by displaying a message or logging an error.
- **Different Image Formats**: Ensure that the image is in a format that can be converted to a `Bitmap`. If the image is a video thumbnail, you might need to handle it differently.

### Step 6: Test the Implementation
- **Take a Photo**: Use the app to take a photo and then run the code to check if the size is correctly calculated.
- **Edge Cases**: Test scenarios where no photo is available or where the image is not a bitmap.

### Additional Considerations
- **Permissions**: Ensure that the app has the necessary permissions to access the photo storage.
- **Performance**: If the photo is large, consider running the size calculation on a background thread to avoid blocking the UI.

By following these steps, you should be able to check the size of the last photo taken using the `MainActivity` and the `last_photo_video_preview` element.
