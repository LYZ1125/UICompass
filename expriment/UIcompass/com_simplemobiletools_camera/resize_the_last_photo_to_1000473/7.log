2025-01-18 15:59:37,796 - INFO - To resize the last photo to 1000:473, you need to locate the code responsible for handling the last photo preview and modify it to resize the image accordingly. Based on the provided layout and activity information, the last photo preview is likely handled in the `MainActivity` and is associated with the `ImageView` with the ID `@+id/last_photo_video_preview`.

Here¡¯s how you can approach this task:

### Step 1: Locate the Code Handling the Last Photo Preview
1. Open the `MainActivity` class (`com.simplemobiletools.camera.activities.MainActivity`).
2. Search for the `last_photo_video_preview` `ImageView` in the code. This is where the last captured photo or video is displayed.

### Step 2: Modify the Image Loading Logic
Once you locate the code that loads the last photo into the `last_photo_video_preview` `ImageView`, you need to resize the image to 1000:473 before displaying it. Here¡¯s an example of how you can do this:

```kotlin
// Assuming you have a reference to the last_photo_video_preview ImageView
val lastPhotoPreview: ImageView = findViewById(R.id.last_photo_video_preview)

// Load the last photo (replace "lastPhotoPath" with the actual path to the last photo)
val lastPhotoPath = getLastPhotoPath() // Implement this method to get the path of the last photo

// Resize the image to 1000:473
val resizedBitmap = resizeBitmap(lastPhotoPath, 1000, 473)

// Set the resized bitmap to the ImageView
lastPhotoPreview.setImageBitmap(resizedBitmap)
```

### Step 3: Implement the `resizeBitmap` Function
You need to implement a function that resizes the bitmap to the desired dimensions (1000:473). Here¡¯s an example:

```kotlin
import android.graphics.Bitmap
import android.graphics.BitmapFactory

private fun resizeBitmap(imagePath: String, width: Int, height: Int): Bitmap {
    // Decode the image file into a Bitmap
    val options = BitmapFactory.Options().apply {
        inJustDecodeBounds = true
    }
    BitmapFactory.decodeFile(imagePath, options)

    // Calculate inSampleSize to load a smaller version of the image
    options.inSampleSize = calculateInSampleSize(options, width, height)

    // Decode the image file into a Bitmap with the calculated inSampleSize
    options.inJustDecodeBounds = false
    val originalBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(imagePath, options)

    // Resize the bitmap to the desired dimensions
    return Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(originalBitmap, width, height, true)
}

private fun calculateInSampleSize(options: BitmapFactory.Options, reqWidth: Int, reqHeight: Int): Int {
    // Raw height and width of image
    val (height: Int, width: Int) = options.run { outHeight to outWidth }
    var inSampleSize = 1

    if (height > reqHeight || width > reqWidth) {
        val halfHeight: Int = height / 2
        val halfWidth: Int = width / 2

        // Calculate the largest inSampleSize value that is a power of 2 and keeps both
        // height and width larger than the requested height and width.
        while (halfHeight / inSampleSize >= reqHeight && halfWidth / inSampleSize >= reqWidth) {
            inSampleSize *= 2
        }
    }

    return inSampleSize
}
```

### Step 4: Test the Changes
1. Run the app and capture a photo.
2. Verify that the last photo preview in the `last_photo_video_preview` `ImageView` is resized to 1000:473.

### Additional Considerations
- **Aspect Ratio**: Ensure that the aspect ratio of the image is maintained if necessary. The provided code resizes the image to exactly 1000:473, which may distort the image if the original aspect ratio is different.
- **Performance**: Resizing large images can be resource-intensive. Consider optimizing the image loading and resizing process if performance issues arise.

By following these steps, you should be able to resize the last photo preview to the desired dimensions (1000:473) in the `MainActivity`.
