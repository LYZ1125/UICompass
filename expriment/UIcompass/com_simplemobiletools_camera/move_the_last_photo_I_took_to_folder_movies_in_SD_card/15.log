2025-01-18 15:34:38,759 - INFO - To achieve the task of moving the last photo taken to the folder `movies` on the SD card, you need to perform the following steps:

### 1. **Identify the Last Photo Taken**
   - The last photo taken is likely stored in the default photo directory, which is typically `Internal/DCIM` or a similar directory specified in the app's settings.
   - You can retrieve the last photo by querying the media store or by checking the most recent file in the directory where photos are saved.

### 2. **Check the Save Location in Settings**
   - From the provided layout, there is a setting for saving photos:
     ```xml
     <com.simplemobiletools.commons.views.MyTextView
         android:id="@+id/settings_save_photos"
         style="@style/SettingsTextValueStyle"
         android:layout_below="@+id/settings_save_photos_label"
         android:text="Internal/DCIM" />
     ```
   - This indicates that the photos are saved in the `Internal/DCIM` directory by default. You may need to change this setting to save photos directly to the SD card if desired.

### 3. **Move the Last Photo to the `movies` Folder**
   - To move the last photo, you need to:
     1. **Identify the file path** of the last photo.
     2. **Create the `movies` directory** on the SD card if it doesn't already exist.
     3. **Move the file** from the current location to the `movies` directory.

### 4. **Implement the Code**
   Here is a sample implementation in Kotlin:

   ```kotlin
   import android.content.Context
   import android.os.Environment
   import java.io.File
   import java.io.IOException

   fun moveLastPhotoToMoviesFolder(context: Context) {
       // Step 1: Get the last photo taken
       val photoDir = File(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DCIM), "Camera")
       val lastPhoto = photoDir.listFiles()?.maxByOrNull { it.lastModified() }

       if (lastPhoto != null) {
           // Step 2: Create the 'movies' directory on the SD card
           val moviesDir = File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "movies")
           if (!moviesDir.exists()) {
               moviesDir.mkdirs()
           }

           // Step 3: Move the file
           val newFile = File(moviesDir, lastPhoto.name)
           try {
               if (lastPhoto.renameTo(newFile)) {
                   // Successfully moved the file
                   println("File moved successfully to ${newFile.absolutePath}")
               } else {
                   // Failed to move the file
                   println("Failed to move the file")
               }
           } catch (e: IOException) {
               e.printStackTrace()
           }
       } else {
           println("No photos found in the directory")
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. **Permissions**
   - Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to read and write to external storage. You need to request the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
     ```
   - Additionally, you need to request these permissions at runtime if your app targets Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.

### 6. **Trigger the Function**
   - You can trigger this function from a button click or any other appropriate event in your app.

### 7. **Testing**
   - Test the functionality on a device with an SD card to ensure that the photo is correctly moved to the `movies` folder.

### 8. **Error Handling**
   - Add appropriate error handling to manage cases where the SD card is not available, the file cannot be moved, or other issues arise.

This approach should help you move the last photo taken to the `movies` folder on the SD card.
