2025-01-18 11:33:23,324 - INFO - To achieve the task of rotating the last picture taken and saving it as `pic4.jpg`, you will need to perform the following steps:

### 1. **Access the Last Picture Taken**
   - The last picture taken is likely stored in the device's gallery or a specific directory where the app saves photos. You need to access this file.

### 2. **Rotate the Image**
   - Once you have the file, you need to rotate it. In Android, you can use the `Bitmap` class to load the image, apply a rotation transformation, and then save it back.

### 3. **Save the Rotated Image as `pic4.jpg`**
   - After rotating the image, save it with the filename `pic4.jpg` in the desired directory.

### Implementation Steps:

#### Step 1: Access the Last Picture Taken
You can access the last picture taken by querying the MediaStore or by knowing the directory where the app saves the photos. If the app saves photos in a specific directory, you can list the files in that directory and get the most recent one.

```java
File directory = new File(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DCIM), "Camera");
File[] files = directory.listFiles();
File lastPhoto = files[files.length - 1]; // Assuming the last file is the most recent photo
```

#### Step 2: Rotate the Image
You can use the `Bitmap` class to load the image and apply a rotation transformation.

```java
Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(lastPhoto.getAbsolutePath());
Matrix matrix = new Matrix();
matrix.postRotate(90); // Rotate 90 degrees to the right
Bitmap rotatedBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(bitmap, 0, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight(), matrix, true);
```

#### Step 3: Save the Rotated Image as `pic4.jpg`
Save the rotated bitmap to a new file named `pic4.jpg`.

```java
File outputFile = new File(directory, "pic4.jpg");
try (FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(outputFile)) {
    rotatedBitmap.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, 100, out);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Full Code Example:

```java
import android.graphics.Bitmap;
import android.graphics.BitmapFactory;
import android.graphics.Matrix;
import android.os.Environment;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ImageRotator {

    public static void rotateLastPhoto() {
        // Step 1: Access the last picture taken
        File directory = new File(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DCIM), "Camera");
        File[] files = directory.listFiles();
        if (files == null || files.length == 0) {
            return; // No photos found
        }
        File lastPhoto = files[files.length - 1];

        // Step 2: Rotate the image
        Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(lastPhoto.getAbsolutePath());
        Matrix matrix = new Matrix();
        matrix.postRotate(90); // Rotate 90 degrees to the right
        Bitmap rotatedBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(bitmap, 0, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight(), matrix, true);

        // Step 3: Save the rotated image as pic4.jpg
        File outputFile = new File(directory, "pic4.jpg");
        try (FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(outputFile)) {
            rotatedBitmap.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, 100, out);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Notes:
- **Permissions**: Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to read and write to external storage.
- **File Handling**: The code assumes that the photos are stored in the `DCIM/Camera` directory. Adjust the directory path as needed.
- **Rotation Angle**: The rotation angle is set to 90 degrees. Adjust this value if you need a different rotation.

### Permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### Runtime Permissions:
If your app targets Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher, you need to request these permissions at runtime.

```java
if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
    ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}, REQUEST_CODE);
}
```

This code should be placed in your `MainActivity` or wherever you initiate the rotation process.

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, you can rotate the last picture taken and save it as `pic4.jpg`. Make sure to handle permissions and file paths correctly to avoid any runtime errors.
