2025-01-16 21:01:57,671 - INFO - To set the audio source to the microphone in your app, you should focus on the activities that are directly related to recording functionality. Based on the list of activities you provided, the most relevant activities are:

1. **`com.simplemobiletools.voicerecorder.activities.MainActivity`**: This is likely the main activity where the recording functionality is initiated or controlled.
2. **`com.simplemobiletools.voicerecorder.activities.BackgroundRecordActivity`**: This activity might handle background recording, which would involve setting the audio source to the microphone.
3. **`com.simplemobiletools.voicerecorder.activities.WidgetRecordDisplayConfigureActivity`**: This activity might be related to configuring widgets for recording, which could involve setting the audio source.

### Steps to Set Audio Source to Microphone:

1. **Identify the Recording Logic**:
   - Look for code in `MainActivity` or `BackgroundRecordActivity` where the `MediaRecorder` or `AudioRecord` is initialized.
   - The audio source is typically set using `MediaRecorder.setAudioSource()` or `AudioRecord.Builder.setAudioSource()`.

2. **Set the Audio Source**:
   - In the `MediaRecorder` or `AudioRecord` initialization code, ensure that the audio source is set to `MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC` or `MediaRecorder.AudioSource.VOICE_RECOGNITION` if you want to use the microphone.
   - Example:
     ```java
     MediaRecorder recorder = new MediaRecorder();
     recorder.setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC);
     recorder.setOutputFormat(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.THREE_GPP);
     recorder.setAudioEncoder(MediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.AMR_NB);
     recorder.setOutputFile(outputFile);
     ```

3. **Check Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the app has the necessary permissions to record audio. This includes the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:
     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
     ```
   - Also, make sure to request this permission at runtime if targeting Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.

4. **Test the Functionality**:
   - Run the app and test the recording functionality to ensure that the audio source is correctly set to the microphone.

### Relevant Activities:

- **`MainActivity`**: Likely contains the main recording logic.
- **`BackgroundRecordActivity`**: Might handle background recording, which would involve setting the audio source.
- **`WidgetRecordDisplayConfigureActivity`**: Could be related to configuring widgets for recording, which might involve setting the audio source.

### Third-Party Activities:
- **`AboutActivity`** and **`CustomizationActivity`** are likely not relevant to setting the audio source, as they are related to app information and customization settings.

By focusing on the activities related to recording, you should be able to locate and modify the code to set the audio source to the microphone.
