2025-01-18 10:50:54,708 - INFO - To achieve the task of sending a text message to Bob with the content "Goodmorning", you need to navigate through the app's activities and interact with the appropriate UI elements. Based on the provided activities and their layouts, here's a step-by-step guide to accomplish this task:

### Step 1: Launch the App
- Start by launching the app, which will open the `SplashActivity`. This activity is typically a loading screen and will automatically transition to the `MainActivity`.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Contact List
- The `MainActivity` is the main screen of the app. It contains a `MyViewPager` (with id `@+id/view_pager`) and a `TabLayout` (with id `@+id/main_tabs_holder`). The `TabLayout` likely contains tabs for different sections, such as contacts, groups, etc.
- Navigate to the "Contacts" tab to view the list of contacts.

### Step 3: Search for Bob
- The `MainActivity` contains a `MySearchMenu` (with id `@+id/main_menu`). Use this search bar to search for "Bob" in the contact list.
- Once you find Bob in the list, tap on his name to open his contact details.

### Step 4: Open Bob's Contact Details
- Tapping on Bob's name will open the `ViewContactActivity`, which displays detailed information about Bob.
- In the `ViewContactActivity`, you will see various UI elements such as the contact's photo, name, phone numbers, emails, etc.

### Step 5: Send a Text Message to Bob
- In the `ViewContactActivity`, locate the `ImageView` with id `@+id/contact_send_sms`. This is the button to send an SMS to Bob.
- Tap on the `contact_send_sms` button. This action should open the default SMS app on the device with Bob's phone number pre-filled.
- In the SMS app, type the message "Goodmorning" and send it.

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Launch the App** ¡ú Opens `SplashActivity` ¡ú Automatically transitions to `MainActivity`.
2. **Navigate to Contacts** ¡ú Use the `TabLayout` to switch to the "Contacts" tab.
3. **Search for Bob** ¡ú Use the `MySearchMenu` to search for "Bob".
4. **Open Bob's Contact Details** ¡ú Tap on Bob's name to open `ViewContactActivity`.
5. **Send SMS** ¡ú Tap on the `contact_send_sms` button to open the SMS app and send "Goodmorning".

### Code Example (if you were to automate this with UI testing):
If you were to automate this process using a UI testing framework like Espresso, the code might look something like this:

```java
// Launch the app
onView(withId(R.id.main_coordinator)).check(matches(isDisplayed()));

// Navigate to the Contacts tab
onView(withId(R.id.main_tabs_holder)).perform(click());

// Search for Bob
onView(withId(R.id.main_menu)).perform(typeText("Bob"), closeSoftKeyboard());

// Open Bob's contact details
onView(withText("Bob")).perform(click());

// Send SMS
onView(withId(R.id.contact_send_sms)).perform(click());

// In the SMS app, type the message and send it
onView(withId(android.R.id.button1)).perform(click()); // Assuming the SMS app has a send button with this ID
```

This is a high-level overview of how you would navigate through the app to send a text message to Bob. The exact implementation details may vary depending on the app's behavior and the device's SMS app.

        Based on the previous analysis,here is the instructions:

        {'task': "Send a text message to Bob with the following content: 'Goodmorning'", 'activities_sequence': [{'activity': 'MainActivity', 'steps': ['1.

        It seems that we were at step-7 in the instructions.  
        You need to refer to the elements on the current interface, combined with the instructions and historical execution information, to determine whether our task has been finished.
        If the task is finished, return {"finish": true, "reason": "Task objective achieved"}; otherwise, return {"finish": false, "reason": "The reason why not finished."}.
