2025-01-17 01:30:25,559 - INFO - To achieve the task of creating a new group named "Classmates," adding Alice, Bob, and Jack to the group, and sending a message "GatheringInTheOldPlace" to the group, you need to interact with the `GroupContactsActivity` and `EditContactActivity` in the app. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this:

### Step 1: Create a New Group
1. **Navigate to `GroupContactsActivity`:**
   - From the `MainActivity`, you need to navigate to the `GroupContactsActivity` where you can manage groups.
   - This might involve clicking on a button or menu item that leads to the group management section.

2. **Create a New Group:**
   - In `GroupContactsActivity`, look for a button or option to create a new group. This could be a Floating Action Button (FAB) with an ID like `@+id/group_contacts_fab`.
   - Click on this button to open a dialog or new activity where you can input the group name.
   - Enter the group name as "Classmates" and confirm the creation.

### Step 2: Add Contacts to the Group
1. **Navigate to `EditContactActivity`:**
   - After creating the group, you need to add contacts to it. This involves editing the contact details of Alice, Bob, and Jack.
   - From the `MainActivity`, navigate to the contact list and select each contact (Alice, Bob, and Jack) one by one to open their details in `ViewContactActivity`.

2. **Edit Contact Details:**
   - In `ViewContactActivity`, look for an option to edit the contact. This might be an edit button or a menu item.
   - Clicking on this option will open `EditContactActivity` where you can modify the contact details.

3. **Add Contact to the Group:**
   - In `EditContactActivity`, look for the section related to groups. This might be a `LinearLayout` with an ID like `@+id/contact_groups_holder`.
   - Within this section, there should be an option to add the contact to a group. This could be a button or a dropdown menu.
   - Select the "Classmates" group from the list and save the changes.

### Step 3: Send a Message to the Group
1. **Navigate to the Group:**
   - After adding all three contacts to the "Classmates" group, navigate back to `GroupContactsActivity`.
   - Select the "Classmates" group from the list of groups.

2. **Send a Message:**
   - In the group details view, look for an option to send a message to the group. This might be a button labeled "Send Message" or similar.
   - Click on this button to open a messaging interface.
   - Enter the message "GatheringInTheOldPlace" and send it to the group.

### Summary of Actions:
1. **Create Group:**
   - Navigate to `GroupContactsActivity`.
   - Use the FAB to create a new group named "Classmates".

2. **Add Contacts:**
   - Navigate to `EditContactActivity` for Alice, Bob, and Jack.
   - Add each contact to the "Classmates" group.

3. **Send Message:**
   - Navigate back to `GroupContactsActivity`.
   - Select the "Classmates" group and send the message "GatheringInTheOldPlace".

This sequence of actions should help you achieve the task using the provided activities and layouts. If any specific IDs or elements are missing or unclear, you may need to refer to the app's documentation or source code for further details.
