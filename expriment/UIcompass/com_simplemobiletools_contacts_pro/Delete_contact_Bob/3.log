2025-01-18 10:41:10,232 - INFO - To achieve the task of deleting a contact named "Bob" in the given Android app, you need to navigate through the app's activities and interact with the appropriate UI elements. Based on the provided information, here's a step-by-step guide to accomplish this:

### Step 1: Launch the App
- The app starts with `SplashActivity`, which likely transitions to `MainActivity` after a brief delay.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Contact List
- In `MainActivity`, the contact list is likely displayed in a `ViewPager` or a similar component. You need to interact with the `ViewPager` to find the contact named "Bob".

### Step 3: Locate the Contact "Bob"
- The contact list is likely displayed in a `RecyclerView` or a similar component within `MainActivity`. You need to scroll through the list to find the contact named "Bob".

### Step 4: Open the Contact Details
- Once you locate "Bob", you need to click on the contact to open the contact details. This action will likely transition to `ViewContactActivity`.

### Step 5: Access the Delete Option
- In `ViewContactActivity`, there should be a menu or an option to delete the contact. The `MaterialToolbar` in `ViewContactActivity` has a menu (`@menu/menu_view_contact`), which likely contains a delete option.

### Step 6: Confirm Deletion
- After selecting the delete option, a confirmation dialog might appear. You need to confirm the deletion to proceed.

### Step 7: Verify Deletion
- After deletion, you should navigate back to `MainActivity` and verify that the contact "Bob" is no longer in the list.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Launch the App**:
   - The app starts with `SplashActivity`, which transitions to `MainActivity`.

2. **Navigate to the Contact List**:
   - In `MainActivity`, the contact list is displayed in a `ViewPager` (`@+id/view_pager`).

3. **Locate the Contact "Bob"**:
   - Scroll through the contact list in the `ViewPager` to find the contact named "Bob".

4. **Open the Contact Details**:
   - Click on the contact "Bob" to open `ViewContactActivity`.

5. **Access the Delete Option**:
   - In `ViewContactActivity`, the `MaterialToolbar` (`@+id/contact_toolbar`) has a menu (`@menu/menu_view_contact`). Click on the menu and select the delete option.

6. **Confirm Deletion**:
   - A confirmation dialog will appear. Confirm the deletion.

7. **Verify Deletion**:
   - Navigate back to `MainActivity` and verify that the contact "Bob" is no longer in the list.

### Code Example (if you were to automate this with UI testing):

```java
// Assuming you are using Espresso for UI testing

// Step 1: Launch the app
// (Automatically handled by the test framework)

// Step 2: Navigate to the contact list
onView(withId(R.id.view_pager)).perform(swipeLeft()); // Adjust swipe direction as needed

// Step 3: Locate the contact "Bob"
onView(withText("Bob")).perform(click());

// Step 4: Open the contact details
// (Automatically handled by the click action above)

// Step 5: Access the delete option
onView(withId(R.id.contact_toolbar)).perform(click()); // Open the menu
onView(withText("Delete")).perform(click()); // Click the delete option

// Step 6: Confirm deletion
onView(withText("OK")).perform(click()); // Confirm the deletion

// Step 7: Verify deletion
onView(withId(R.id.view_pager)).perform(swipeLeft()); // Navigate back to the contact list
onView(withText("Bob")).check(doesNotExist()); // Verify that "Bob" is no longer in the list
```

### Notes:
- The exact IDs and menu options might differ based on the actual implementation.
- The above steps assume that the contact list is displayed in a `ViewPager` and that the delete option is available in the toolbar menu.
- If the app uses a different navigation pattern or UI components, you might need to adjust the steps accordingly.

This approach should help you delete the contact "Bob" from the app.
